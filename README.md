# Git Demo using 99bottles in Java

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to create an automated demonstration
of git using "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" (starting at 4 bottles left).

The Java source files will be staged at each change, rather than diffs
in order for future development using Windows command-prompt/PowerShell.

Initially, this will be developed using BASH.
